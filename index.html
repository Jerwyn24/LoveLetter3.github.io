You're some kind of second father/brother/partner-in-crime/bodyguard all rolled into one. We've taken on the world, together, side-by-side. The truth is, I don't think I could do it without you.
                                                                     College hasn't changed us. Not one bit. We might be busy with school, work, family and relationships, but we always have time for each other when there's a minute to breathe. I know I complain more than I should, but you always listen. Without hesitation, in fact. I can't thank you enough for that.
